# FinOps Maturity Assessment

[work in progress]

This is an assessment of the FinOps maturity level of an organization. The questionnaire has six areas of assessment, where each area has a maximum score of 100 points. Each area has a minimum of 4 questions, and each question has a maximum score of 25 points. The final score is calculated by adding up all points and dividing the total by 100. The highest achievable score is 6, while a score around 5 is considered an above average maturity level.

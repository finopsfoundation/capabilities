# FinOps Maturity Assessment

This questionnaire assesses the FinOps maturity level of an organization. There are six areas, each is limited to 100 points, and a question is limited to 25 points. Divide the total points achieved by 100 to get the final score. A score around 5 is considered an above average maturity level.

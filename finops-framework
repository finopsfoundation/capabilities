# FinOps Framework

[work in progress]

- A unified framework for what is required to build a practice
- Capabilities required for the entire practice
- Split up by Persona, driven by SIGs (finance, eng, etc)
- Each with KPIs attached
- RACI of who responsibility
- Outcome is learning objectives for exam
- Learning objectives feed training curriculums
- Training curriculums feed materials
- Tooling supports accomplishment of capabilities
- Some capabilities are internal muscle, some are software, some are services
- Survey/data (SIG?) supports benchmarking data on all these
- Benchmark data quantitately shows what great looks like in each area


## TAC drives continuous improvement and alignment of framework

- SIGs own portions of the framework
- SIGs recommend quarterly (TBD) updates to the framework to the TAC
- TAC votes quaterly (TBD) to update framework

## Community support enables contribution and learning

FinOps Foundation is an aggregator and enabler of discussion and evolution of the practice.

- Slack
- Centralized view into regional, topical and persona based events (meetups, vendor discussions, FinOps member meetings)
- Live discussion forums for sharing of best practices
- Community discussions drive improved framework, each event's takeaways captured and integrated

## FinOps Certifications verify an understanding of the framework
- Persona based certifications hosted by the Linux Foundation 
- SIGs define what each persona needs to know
- That knowledge is translated into exam questions
- LF/FinOps work with training partners to develop content to teach the framework

## FCP, FCSP, FTP support enabling the framework

Vendor members work to be the best at providing solutions to the capabilties in the framework. E.g. Platforms, Service Providers, Training Partners. To qualify for the FinOps Certified program a vendor needs to provide solutions for a specific number of capabilities. Each checked line item adds to the total score. The exact amount of capabilities a vendor needs to support to certify will change / increase over time as the industry matures (requirements to be defined by the TAC).

- [ ] Align cloud decision makers with FinOps goals
- [ ] Cost visualization caters to different levels in the organization e.g. executive versus leadership versus engineer
- [ ] Cost data is up-to-date, meaning less than 2 days old
- [ ] Support amortization of prepayment products (Committed Use Discounts, Reservations, Savings Plans)
- [ ] Dynamically calculate custom rates and amortization metrics
- [ ] Create showback and chargeback reporting
- [ ] Support fully loaded costs incl. enterprise discounts, private pricing agreements, support fees, costs for site licenses etc.
- [ ] Define tagging strategy and support management of tagging rules
- [ ] Manage tagging compliance e.g. enforcement, alerting, and auto correction
- [ ] Define budgets and report actual versus budget
- [ ] Define forecasts and report forecast versus actual variance
- [ ] Alert and visualize budget overages
- [ ] Alert and visualize cost spikes that may not be large enough to impact budgets
- [ ] Support FinOps program tracking through e.g. program specific KPIs
- [ ] Able to provide visibility into how your organization performs across the industry

## Rate Reduction

- [ ] Visualize effect of enterprise discounts, private pricing agreements
- [ ] Visualize effect of custom discounts, volume discounts
- [ ] Visualize, report, and track the effect of sustained usage discounts

- [ ] Recommend optimizations to existing licensing portfolio
- [ ] Visualize coverage and utilization of prepayment products (Committed Use Discounts, Reservations, Savings Plans) and show trending over time
- [ ] Analyze effectiveness of existing prepayment portfolio and provide improvement recommendations
- [ ] Recommendations allow balancing of various rate types
- [ ] Select discounts that match your flexibility
- [ ] Utilize the marketplace when making recommendations
- [ ] Provide purchase recommendations for prepayment products (Committed Use Discounts, Reservations, Savings Plans)
- [ ] Recommendations are aware of seasonality
- [ ] Recommendations are aware of auto scaling workloads
- [ ] Visualize, recommend, manage, and track capacity reservations

## Cost Avoidance

- [ ] Visualize, recommend, and track right-sizing opportunities within a compute family
- [ ] Visualize, recommend, and track right-sizing opportunities across compute families
- [ ] Allow user prompted remediation of right-sizing opportunities
- [ ] Submit pull requests for right-sizing recommendations
- [ ] Leverag Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automation for cost avoidance
- [ ] Able to benchmark the performance of cloud workloads
- [ ] Visualize, recommend, manage, and track cloud parking opportunities
- [ ] Visualize, recommend, and track unrealized savings opportunities (underused, unused, orphaned resources)
- [ ] Allow user prompted remediation of unrealized savings opportunities (underused, unused, orphaned resources)
- [ ] Auto remediate unrealized savings opportunities (stopping of unused resources, deletion of orphaned resources, data lifecycle management)
- [ ] Visualize and track realized cost avoidance opportunities
- [ ] Provide visibility into container utilization e.g. node utilization, pod utilization
- [ ] Report, track, manage, and enforce red / green zone policies
- [ ] Alert, report, track, manage, and enforce policies and governance in the cloud

## Benchmark Performance
